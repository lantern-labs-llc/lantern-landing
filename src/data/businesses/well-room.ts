            "Infrared sauna therapy uses infrared light wavelengths to heat the body directly, rather than heating the surrounding air like a traditional sauna. Because the heat targets your body rather than the room, infrared saunas operate at lower, more comfortable air temperatures — typically 110–150°F compared to 150–195°F in a traditional Finnish sauna.",
            "There are two main types of infrared wavelengths used in sauna therapy:",
            "<strong>Near-infrared</strong> has a shorter wavelength and is absorbed closer to the skin's surface. It's associated with skin health, wound healing, and cellular repair. Near-infrared is the same wavelength range used in red light therapy devices.",
            "<strong>Far-infrared</strong> has a longer wavelength and penetrates deeper into tissue — research suggests approximately 1–2 inches. It's the primary driver of the deep warming and sweating effect. Far-infrared has been the focus of most clinical studies on infrared sauna therapy.",

            "Research on infrared saunas is growing but still early-stage. Most of the robust, large-scale sauna research has been conducted on traditional Finnish saunas. However, a body of smaller studies on infrared saunas shows promising results across several areas.",
            "<strong>Cardiovascular health:</strong> A 2018 review published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings found that regular sauna bathing is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events, lower blood pressure, and improved vascular function. A 2009 review in Canadian Family Physician found that far-infrared sauna therapy showed benefits for systolic blood pressure, congestive heart failure symptoms, and vascular endothelial function, with no adverse events reported across the studies reviewed.",
            "<strong>Pain and muscle recovery:</strong> A two-year study found infrared sauna therapy to be a promising method for treatment of chronic pain. Smaller studies have shown reduced delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) when using infrared sauna after intense exercise. A 2009 study also found infrared saunas can improve short-term pain and stiffness for those with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.",
            "<strong>Stress and relaxation:</strong> Heat exposure triggers the release of endorphins and can lower cortisol levels. While this is harder to quantify in clinical studies, subjective well-being and relaxation are consistently reported benefits across sauna research. A systematic review of 40 clinical studies found that sauna bathing may improve quality of life, with no serious adverse events reported.",
            "<strong>What's not well-supported:</strong> Some commonly marketed claims lack strong evidence. Detoxification through sweating is frequently promoted, but medical experts note that the liver and kidneys — not sweat glands — are the body's primary detoxification organs. Cleveland Clinic and WebMD have both noted that detox claims are \"more marketing than science\" for most healthy individuals. Claims about significant weight loss are also overstated; any weight lost during a session is primarily water weight from sweating.",

        { question: "What is infrared sauna therapy?", answer: "Infrared sauna therapy uses infrared light to heat the body directly, rather than heating the air like a traditional sauna. It operates at lower, more comfortable temperatures (110–150°F vs. 150–195°F) while still inducing a deep sweat. Well Room's sauna uses both near-infrared (carbon) and far-infrared (ceramic) wavelengths." },
        { question: "What does the research say about infrared sauna benefits?", answer: "Research is emerging but promising. Studies have shown potential benefits for cardiovascular health, chronic pain, post-exercise muscle recovery, and stress reduction. A 2018 review in Mayo Clinic Proceedings found regular sauna bathing linked to reduced cardiovascular risk. However, some popular claims (especially around detoxification and weight loss) are not well-supported by current evidence. Infrared sauna is best understood as a complementary wellness practice." },
        { question: "How is this different from a traditional sauna?", answer: "Traditional saunas heat the air to 150–195°F; infrared saunas use light to heat the body directly at 110–150°F. Both induce sweating and raise core temperature. Many people find infrared more comfortable, especially those new to sauna therapy or who find traditional heat overwhelming." },
        { question: "What should I wear?", answer: "Loose, comfortable clothing or a towel. The room is private — wear whatever feels right." },
        { question: "Should I eat before?", answer: "A light snack is fine, but avoid heavy meals. Skip caffeine and alcohol, as they increase dehydration." },
        { question: "Can I bring my phone?", answer: "Yes. The sauna has Bluetooth connectivity, so you can stream music, podcasts, or whatever helps you relax." },
        { question: "How often should I go?", answer: "Most regular users go 1–3 times per week. If you're new, start with once a week and shorter sessions, then build up based on how you feel. Cleveland Clinic recommends limiting sessions to three to four times per week." },
        { question: "Is it safe?", answer: "For most healthy adults, yes. No serious adverse events have been reported in clinical studies. People with cardiovascular conditions, peripheral neuropathy, autoimmune conditions, or who are pregnant should consult a doctor first. Stay hydrated and don't exceed 45 minutes per session." },
        { question: "Who should avoid infrared saunas?", answer: "People who have difficulty sensing temperature changes (peripheral neuropathy), certain heart conditions, autoimmune conditions, or who are pregnant should talk to their doctor first. Anyone taking medications that affect sweating or heat tolerance should also check with a healthcare provider." },
        { question: "Are the rooms private?", answer: "Yes. Well Room's infrared sauna room is always private — never shared with other clients. It's a spacious room with a 4-person sauna, so you can also bring a partner or friend." },
