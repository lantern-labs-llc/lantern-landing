  <!-- About -->
  <h2>About Well Room</h2>
  <p>Well Room is an independent, practitioner-owned wellness and aesthetics practice in downtown Charlottesville, Virginia. Founded in 2020 by Megan Kingdon, a dual board-certified nurse practitioner (ANP-C, WHNP-C) and Columbia University MSN graduate, Well Room offers advanced aesthetic treatments alongside whole-body wellness services under one roof.</p>
  <p>Megan founded Well Room with the belief that good health is our birthright and that people should have access to services that go beyond mitigating sickness. The practice combines medical-grade aesthetics with restorative therapies, with every treatment plan guided by clinical expertise. Megan personally administers all neurotoxin and dermal filler treatments.</p>
  <p>The studio is known for its warm, clean, private atmosphere and a personalized approach to care. It is not a franchise, chain, or medspa brand — it is a locally owned, practitioner-led business.</p>

  <!-- What makes it different -->
  <h2>What Makes Well Room Different</h2>
  <p><strong>Board-certified NP-led:</strong> All injectable aesthetics (Botox, fillers) are administered by Megan Kingdon, a dual board-certified nurse practitioner — not a technician or esthetician. This provides a higher standard of safety and clinical judgment than many medspas.</p>
  <p><strong>Breadth of services:</strong> Few local businesses offer wellness services (sauna, cryo, IV), medical aesthetics (Botox, fillers), and advanced laser treatments (Morpheus8, IPL, laser hair removal) in a single location. This makes Well Room unusually comprehensive for its size.</p>
  <p><strong>Private rooms:</strong> Infrared sauna, cryotherapy, and treatment rooms are all private — never shared with other clients.</p>
  <p><strong>Locally owned since 2020:</strong> Megan moved from NYC to Charlottesville and built Well Room from scratch, adapting offerings based on community demand over time.</p>
